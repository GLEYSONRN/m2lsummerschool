        "This is the tutorial of the 2024 [Mediterranean Machine Learning Summer School](https://www.m2lschool.org/) on Natural Language Processing!\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial will explore the fundamental aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Basic Python programming skills are expected.\n",
        "Prior knowledge of standard NLP techniques (e.g. text tokenization and classification with ML) is beneficial but optional when working through the notebooks as they assume minimal prior knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial combines detailed analysis and development of essential NLP concepts via custom (i.e. from scratch) implementations. Other necessary NLP components will be developed using PyTorch's NLP library implementations. As a result, the tutorial offers deep understanding and facilitates easy usage in future applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "GPU access is recommended for optimal performance, particularly for model training and text generation. While all code can run on CPU, a CUDA-enabled environment will significantly speed up these processes.\n",

        "  - **Example:** For the sentence \"Hello, world!\", character-level tokenization would result in tokens: ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!']\n",

        "3. **Byte-Level Byte Pair Encoding (Byte-level BPE):**\n",
        "  - **Description:** Byte-level BPE tokenization operates on bytes of the input text. It uses a merge operation to gradually build a vocabulary of byte pairs, making it useful for handling multilingual texts and rare characters. Used by e.g. GPT-2, RoBERTa.\n",
        "  - **Example:** It creates tokens based on byte pairs, such as \"b\" and \"an\" merging into a single token of \"ban\".\n",
        "4. **WordPiece Tokenization:**\n",
        "  - **Description:** WordPiece tokenization breaks words into smaller units. It begins with a basic vocabulary of individual characters and merges the most frequent character sequences to form new tokens. Used by e.g. BERT, DistilBERT, and Electra.\n",
        "  - **Example:** For the word \"tokenization\", WordPiece might create tokens like \"token\", \"##ization\" where \"##\" indicates continuation.\n",

# M2L Summer School 2024 (Milan - Italy) 🇮🇹  

## My Experience at M2L Summer School  
I had the incredible opportunity to attend the **M2L Summer School 2024**, an intensive program focused on cutting-edge topics in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence**. Organized by **Google DeepMind Researchers** in **Milan, Italy**, this event brought together researchers and practitioners to explore both foundational and advanced concepts in AI.  

During the program, I deepened my understanding of key topics, including:  

- **Natural Language Processing**
- **Generative and Diffusion Models**
- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Graph Neural Networks**
- **Self-Supervised Learning**
- **Applied Deep Learning**
- **Neuroscience**
- **Ethics in Machine Learning**

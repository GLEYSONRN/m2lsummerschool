# 🎓 M2L Summer School 2024 (Milan - Italy) 🇮🇹  

## 🌍 My Experience at M2L Summer School  
I had the incredible opportunity to attend the **M2L Summer School 2024**, an intensive program focused on cutting-edge topics in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence** 🤖.  

Organized by **Google DeepMind Researchers** in **Milan, Italy**, this event brought together researchers and practitioners to explore both foundational and advanced concepts in AI.  

During the program, I deepened my understanding of key topics, including:  

📌 **Natural Language Processing**  
📌 **Generative and Diffusion Models**  
📌 **Reinforcement Learning**  
📌 **Graph Neural Networks**   
📌 **Self-Supervised Learning**  
📌 **Applied Deep Learning**   
📌 **Neuroscience**  
📌 **Ethics in Machine Learning**
